TODO
====

(from highest-prio-or-simplest to lowest-prio-or-longterm):

 * In iamc/iambot use argparse (e.g. --help,--version,--verbose,--no-sys-config,
   --no-home-config)

 * Move more functions into iam_common.py (anything reusable in iam/iambot)

 * Add server returning statuses for a user (at present just returns all statuses for all users)

 * Add recursive merging of *SysConfig and *Config in iamd

 * Use patch to tweak "http" in iamd.l, rather than the present total rewrite

 * Add user-authentication in iamd (then clients/bot of course)

 * Cache logfiles-content in iamd based on (info [filename]), to reduce disk IO

 * Other protocols, SSL, etc

 * Finish form/database version of iamd (interactive webapp, jquery live-update, etc)

 * Optional json output from iamd

 * Rewrite clients/bot/libs in picolisp

 * Add POST to iamd for updating data, eventually (perhaps) full REST API

FIXME
=====

 * Fix launching terminal-browser in xterm in iamc.py

 * Fix generating sexpressions from python
