======

iamd is a server which receives and displays updates about what you are
presently doing, hence the name:
 (i.e. "I am working on icinga alerts" => iam "working on icinga alerts")

----

iamd.l is a statuses server, designed for simplicity/speed/reliability,
and for info to be easily viewed from any browser.

iamc.py is an interactive client for posting statuses to - and getting info
directly from - iamd.

iam.sh is a minimal tool for posting statuses non-interactively.

iambot.py is a jabberbot to relay status commands from a chatserver to the
statuses server (work in progress, almost works...).
